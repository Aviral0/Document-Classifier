# Document-Classifier
Cactus deals in 12 document types and three of the doc types are the most important, as they witness the maximum traffic and maximum revenue. 

My job was to build a classifier which can classify these three doc-types. Some of the approaches I took:
1. Rule based classifier (word count, keywords)
2. Converting the doc to TFIDF vectors and feeding them to ML classifiers such as Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost, AdaBoost, KNN
3. Deep Leaning models such as MLP and CNN-1D using both PyTorch and Keras
4. Achieved the best accuracy on Random Forest ~84% and deployed it as well
5. Created a front end using streamlit for demo infront of CTO (which was widely appreciated)

From understanding both the business criticality and till deployment, it was my first proper stint into the tech world. I am pleased with the results. 
The work was appreciated and I was offered a Pre-Placememt Offer
